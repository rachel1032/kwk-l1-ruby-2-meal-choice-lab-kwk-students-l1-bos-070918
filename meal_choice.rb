# Here's an example of a 'snacks' method that returns the meal choice passed in to it and defaults to "cheetos" if nothing is passed in.
def snacks(food="Cheetos")
  "Any time, is the right time for #{food}!"
end

# Define breakfast, lunch and dinner methods that return the meal choice passed into them. If nothing is passed in, it shoud default to the foods on

def breakfast(food1 = "frosted flakes")
 "Morning is the best time for #{food1}"
 puts #{food1}
end

def lunch(food2= "grilled cheese")
 "Lunch is the best time for #{food2}"
end

def dinner(food3= "salmon")
 "Dinner is the best time for #{food3}"
end

# Call the methods with puts and your own arguments here. Like this:
puts snacks("Swedish fish")
## This returns "Any time, is the right time for Sweedish fish!"

# call your methods here


# Call your methods without any arguments here
puts snacks
## In our snacks method, the default choice is "Cheetos" Calling snacks like this without specifying a choice will return "Any time, is the right time for Cheetos!"
